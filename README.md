# SienaPracticeProblems
My practice for the Siena College High School Programming Contest (http://contest.sienacs.com/) in Kotlin

The contest only allows Java, Python, and C. I'm not sure if Kotlin is allowed even though it runs on the JVM technically but I'm doing this more as practice for myself to get into the mindset. I am using IntelliJ IDEA, but the competition is done in BlueJ.
